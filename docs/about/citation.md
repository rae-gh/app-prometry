## Citing Data from PROMETRY

When using data generated by PROMETRY in publications:

1. **Acknowledge the tool**:
   > "Geometric parameters were calculated using PROMETRY (Alcraft & Williams, 2023)."

2. **Describe the method**:
   > "CA-CA distances were calculated for all residue pairs within 8 Å using PROMETRY v0.1.0."

3. **Include parameters**:
   > "Phi and psi angles were calculated using PROMETRY with the geometric definitions: 
   > phi (C(i-1)-N-CA-C) and psi (N-CA-C-N(i+1))."

## Examples in Different Contexts

### In Methods Section

```
Protein structure analysis was performed using PROMETRY v0.1.0 
(Alcraft & Williams, 2023), a Python library for calculating geometric 
parameters. Structures were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) 
and analyzed for backbone dihedral angles (phi, psi), inter-residue 
distances, and secondary structure assignments via DSSP (Kabsch & Sander, 1983).
Contact maps were generated by calculating CA-CA distances with a threshold 
of 8.0 Å, excluding sequential neighbors (i to i+4).
```

### In Figure Captions

```

structure 1T29. Generated using PROMETRY (Alcraft & Williams, 2023).
```

### In Acknowledgments

```
We thank Rachel Alcraft for developing PROMETRY, which was used for 
protein structure analysis in this work.
```
