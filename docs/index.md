## A library to calculate geometric parameters of protein structures and perform criteria search

PROMETRY is a powerful Python library designed for analyzing protein structures through geometric parameter calculations and criteria-based searches.

## Key Features

- **Geometric Search Language**: Define and search for distances, angles, and dihedrals using standard protein atom nomenclature
- **Flexible Criteria**: Apply distance constraints and amino acid restrictions to refine searches
- **Multiple Applications**: Generate contact maps, identify nearest neighbors, analyze hydrogen bonds, and create correlation plots like Ramachandran diagrams
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Create publication-ready plots and 3D structure visualizations
- **Data Export**: Download dataframes and plots for further analysis

## Live Application

The application is freely hosted by Streamlit: **[PROMETRY](https://prometry.streamlit.app)**
